IMP: pytest class name should start with 'Test'

*command to run pytest testcases from command prompt :
pytest -v -s testCases/test_login.py

*.ini file is a config file. But our test case classes cant read directly from .ini file.
We need to create an utility file through which data from .ini file is being read in the test case classes.

* IMP: If for any webelement, click() is not working, then use execute_script() method:
driver.execute_script(<webelement>.click())

* In pytest, in order to group test cases, we need to use 'marker' and add @pytest.mark.<custom name> to test
case class on top of specific test method. More than one markers can be added to a test method.
In order to make pytest recognize these custom markers, we need to create pytest.ini file
and need to add those markers in it.

* Running test cases through .bat file : this will run test cases in command prompt outside pycharm
Create this file in the same folder of your project file in the local system
You can write multiple running commands BUT only the command you want to run at that moment, except that:
put 'rem' infront of the other commands to ignore them at the runtime
Go to the location where .bat file is saved and double click to run it

* Continuous Integration through Jenkins:
In realtime scenario: Jenkins is installed in the system of the Devops team members, they will share an url
for Jenkins GUI which we have to access using our authorised credentials (Jenkins is a web based application).
*Tester's responsibility is to set up testing project in Jenkins & ensure testing project is running
successfully in Jenkins.

*Open Jenkins GUI:
http://localhost:8080/
Initial admin pwd: fc52618049eb49c5a8e59a41e91fb597

Set up Jenkins - Credentials:
Username = Ninja16180
pwd = 1qazZAQ!
emai = vinci.16180@gmail.com

----------

Git:
* Git command prompt: Go to the very directory in your local system> right click > git bash here

Steps :
1. git init <--creates empty git repo
2. Establish connection between local git & remote github repo:
    - Github repo url: https://github.com/Ninja16180/eCommerce_Hybrid_Framework.git
    - Command: git remote add origin https://github.com/Ninja16180/eCommerce_Hybrid_Framework.git
3. git commit
Pre-req: Before running git commit for the first time, run these two commands:
git config --global user.name "Ninja"
git config --global user.email "vinci.16180@gmail.com"

4. Add non committed files to staging area:
git add -A
